# A Data Warehouse Approach for Predictive Modeling of CoastalBiodiversity Loss : A Case Study of Navi Mumbai’s Intertidal Wetlands 🌍

## Project Overview 🚀

​A seven-year time series analysis of mangrove ecosystem health and extent across the critical Panvel, Uran, and Thane Creek subregions of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. This project fused remote sensing data with advanced machine learning techniques (OLAP) to quantify change, analyze long-term trends, and statistically identify the key drivers of localized degradation.

​Key Achievements & Quantified Results
​Net Ecosystem Gain vs. Local Loss: Quantified a substantial overall resilience, resulting in a net gain of 1506.4 Hectares of mangrove cover. However, the analysis isolated 1196.9 Hectares of localized degradation during the study period.

​Identified Primary Stressor (OLAP): Utilized the Weka Apriori algorithm to statistically prove the non-random nature of health loss. The analysis demonstrated a high-confidence association (Confidence 0.92, Lift 1.78) that severe degradation is concentrated in the Panvel subregion during the Dry Season.
​Actionable Recommendation: Provided a data-driven recommendation to prioritize enforcement and water resource management in the Panvel region during the vulnerable dry months.

​Remote Sensing & GEE: Developed and executed complex GEE scripts using JavaScript to acquire, clean, and process the entire Sentinel-2 Level-2A time series (2018–2024). Calculated and utilized NDVI and EVI to derive health composites and long-term time series plots.

​Geospatial Analysis (QGIS): Performed raster algebra to create a Red-White-Green Change Map (NDVI) and utilized QGIS's Reclassify and Polygonize tools to convert the continuous change raster into vector boundaries for precise area quantification (Hectares).

​Data Mining (Weka/OLAP): Implemented an OLAP-style Star Schema in Python/ARFF format to structure the temporal data. Used Weka's K-Means Clustering to categorize health states and the Apriori Algorithm (Association Rules) to link spatial/temporal attributes to degradation outcomes, providing statistically verified insights.
